        <h3>Influx of Miners Coming!<small> 2.4.2015</small></h3>
        <p>Professor Evan's issued a dire warning today to those who 
        wait to start collecting coins. Since the difficulty of mining
        readjusts to the number of miners working on blocks, the longer a
        miner waits to start the harder it becomes to collect coins.
        </p>
        <p>
        The TA's echoed this concern, but acknowledge that unforseen, calamatous events
        on the network will readjust the required coin threshold in the student's favor.
        More news to follow.

        <h3>The Network is Live! <small> 2.2.2015</small></h3>
        <p>The dashing TA's for UVA's CryptoCurrency Cafe course launched PointCoin, an
        entirely unique digital cash system, last night. The digital currency is dedicated to creating 
        a fixed peg between points on Project 2 and coins held by account holders
        enrolled in CS 4501.
        </p>
        <p>Staff had several reasons for establishing their own currency. The main goal
        was to give students tangible exerpience interacting with these
        new digital cash schemes at the network level. They also wanted students
        to mine these coins using their own hardware.
        </p>
        <p>When questioned further the instructor admits that other goods
        will be redeemable with PointCoin. Exactly what goods are for sale is yet to be revealed.

        <h3>Internet Pizza for Sale!<small> 2.23.2015</small></h3>
        <p>Proffessor Evans revealed today that a <a href="http://pizza.bitcoin-class.org">market place</a> for purchasing pizza
        with pointcoin has just launched. Anonymous sources at office hours on Friday
        revealed that the first Papa John's pizza was delivered to them for an undisclosed
        amount.
        </p>
        <p>Right now, three different types of pizza are available for purchase from the site.
        Evan's warned today that given the profusion of pointcoin recently the price for that
        pizza will be rising.
        The real operator of the site has yet to reveal himself, but it is suspected that Dave
        himself is financially backing the operation. More to come...

        <h3>PointCoin is Dead. Long Live PointCoin!<small> 2.15.2015</small></h3>
        <p>After network outages and numerous forks, teaching staff decided to restart
        the PointCoin block chain with better rules on Wednesday of this week. The new
        block chain will have a higher difficulty and a longer block time to prevent the 
        sort of outages that occured last week.
        </p>
        <p>A soft launch of the new PointCoin network was completed on Monday and it has been
        opened up for students to join since then. At the time of this writing <a href="http://safari.bitcoin-class.org">Point
            Safari</a> is reporting the new chain faithfully. It is yet to be determined 
        if this new network is more resilient than the last.

        <h3>Influx of Miners Coming!<small> 2.9.2015</small></h3>
        <p>Professor Evans' issued a dire warning today to those who 
        wait to start collecting coins. Since the difficulty of mining
        readjusts to the number of miners working on blocks, the longer a
        miner waits to start the harder it becomes to collect coins.
        </p>
        <p>
        The TA's echoed this concern, but acknowledge that unforseen, calamatous events
        on the network will readjust the required coin threshold in the student's favor.
        More news to follow.

        <h3>The Network is Live! <small> 2.2.2015</small></h3>
        <p>The dashing TA's for UVA's CryptoCurrency Cafe course launched PointCoin, an
        entirely unique digital cash system, last night. The digital currency is dedicated to creating 
        a fixed peg between points on Project 2 and coins held by account holders
        enrolled in CS 4501.
        </p>
        <p>Staff had several reasons for establishing their own currency. The main goal
        was to give students tangible exerpience interacting with these
        new digital cash schemes at the network level. They also wanted students
        to mine these coins using their own hardware.
        </p>
        <p>When questioned further the instructor admits that other goods
        will be redeemable with PointCoin. Exactly what goods are for sale is yet to be revealed.
